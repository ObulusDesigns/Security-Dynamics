# Images Directory Structure

## Logo
Place the Security Dynamics Inc logo in the `/logo` directory. The logo will be used to extract the primary brand colors for the entire website.

## Directory Structure
- `/logo` - Company logos and brand assets
- `/icons` - Small icons and badges (certifications, awards, etc.)
- `/services` - Service-related images (access control, surveillance, etc.)
- `/hero` - Hero section images and backgrounds
- `/team` - Team member photos

## Image Requirements
- Logo: PNG or SVG format preferred
- Icons: SVG format for scalability
- Photos: WebP or optimized JPEG/PNG
- All images should be optimized for web performance

## Next Steps

2. The color scheme will be automatically extracted from the logo
3. All design elements will adapt to match the brand colors
